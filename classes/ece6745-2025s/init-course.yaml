     The exam is closed book, closed notes. You may use a calculator if you
     wish. An appendix at the end of the exam will include a list of the
     technology parameters and logical effort equations.

 - name: "Project Pre-Proposal"
   description: >-
     The goal of the preproposal is to get you think about project ideas
     and to start some preliminary literature search. You can find project
     ideas and more information about the literature search in the 
     <i>Project Ideas</i> handout linked off the Canvas handouts page.


     The project preproposal should be a 1-2 page PDF submitted via this
     assignment. The preproposal should describe who will be in your group
     and what you want to explore in your project. If you are trying to
     decide between two projects you can include a description of both.
     This is relatively informal, but I really want to start the discussion
     about projects early in the semester. Please feel free to talk with me
     after lecture or in office hours about project ideas -- or post on Ed
     (public or private is fine). The preproposal is not binding. You can
     change your mind after the proposal once we have more time to discuss.

 - name: "Project Proposal"
   description: >-
     The proposal should be maybe 2-3 pages. It should be a step towards
     the introduction for the final project report. So you should include
     a paragraph or two about the motivation for the project, a paragraph
     or two that describes your plan for the baseline and alternative
     design, a paragraph or two that describes how you plan to test and
     evaluate your design, and a few paragraphs for the literature review.
     Your annotated bibliography should go at the end. Note -- you must
     annotate at least three scholarly references, but you do not need
     to annotate every reference. Feel free to include as many references
     as you like. You can find project ideas and more information about
     the literature search in the <i>Project Ideas</i> handout on the
     Canvas handouts page.

   description: >-
     You should submit a PDF of your project final report which includes
     an introduction based on your proposal (including the literature
     search) along with the baseline design section and the testing strategy
     section.


     Please see the Project Report Assessment Rubric for more information
     about report formatting and the various sections that are required in
     the final report.

   description: >-
     You should submit a PDF of your project final report which includes
     everything you have written so far. So this includes an introduction
     based on your proposal (including the literature search), the baseline
     design section and the testing strategy section from the first
     milestone, and the alternative design section.

     You should submit a PDF of your project final report which includes

     based on your proposal (including the literature search), the baseline
     design section and the testing strategy section from the first
     milestone, the alternative design section from the second milestone,
     and the evaluation document. You should now have a relatively complete
     first draft of your design project final report.

     about report formatting and the various sections that are required in
     the final report.

 - name: "Design Project Demonstrations"
   description: >-
     The demo is very important. The demo will last about 30 minutes and we
     will schedule the time slots a week or so before the demo. You are in
     charge of driving the demo, but I imagine it will look like this:

     <ol>
       <li>Walk me through your code using GitHub [this is how I will assess
       code quality]. It can really help if you have block diagrams, datapath
       diagrams, and/or FSM diagrams printed out so you can use these diagrams
       to help explain the code.</li>
       <li>Show me something interesting in the code, maybe a particularly
       clever way you coded something, or some particularly well written code.</li>
       <li>I will then clone your repo and run all of your unit tests -- you
       should be ready to briefly explain your testing strategy so I can
       understand what the tests are testing, do not have broken tests in your
       repo for the demo -- make sure "py.test .." works! Even better, you
       can show me all of the tests passing on GitHub Actions.</li>
       <li>Then you should run some kind of simulator for your baseline design
       so I can see your baseline design working. Then you should run some kind
       of simulator for your alternative design so I can see your alternative
       design working. Make sure the simulators work!</li>
       <li>For the demo you really must have some kind of slick line tracing,
       and then you should be able to enable this line tracing so that I can
       truly visualize the alternative design really working. So you would
       point to parts of the line trace on the monitor in my office and talk
       me through how the transactions move through your design, how an FSM
       moves through the stats, where parts of the design are stalling, etc.
       You should think very carefully what is the best test or dataset to use
       for the demo and what is the best way to put together a nice line trace
       to really show off how things are working.</li>
     </ol>

     Note that a key aspect of the demo is that I should be able to run the
     tests and the simulator from a clean clone of the GitHub repo on the ecelinux
     servers. This means no magic versions of the code that only work on your laptop,
     (hopefully) no special tools that only you have access to, and no extremely
     complicated command line sequences to try out your project. Everything should
     be clean and simple to do from a clean git clone, and everything should work
     on the ecelinux servers. There may be some exceptions but that should be
     discussed ahead of time.


     The demos are usually quite a bit of fun and a good way to really demonstrate
     all you have learned over the past 9 months. My intention is that students get
     the code working in time for the demo day, and then focus on the final report
     for the last few days before the report is due. While you can still hack on
     the code after the demo day, if the project is not working on the demo day
     then I consider the project to not work. So usually students make sure everything
     is working for the demo day and at least some kind of evaluation is ready. Then
     sometimes they do a bit more hacking after the demo day to add some more
     evaluations or to really dive deeper into the results.

quizzes:
 - title: "GitHub Username Form"
   description: >-
     We will be using GitHub to distribute and grade the lab assignments. 
     Students will also be using GitHub to collaborate with their lab
     partner on lab assignments. In order to invite students to the
     course's GitHub organization we need to know your NetID and your
     GitHub username.


     <b>NOTE</b>: We do NOT use the Cornell GitHub. We use the public
     github.com system which means you need to explicitly have an account
     on github.com. If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to
     https://github.com/join. Make sure you use your netid@cornell.edu
     email address if you are creating a new account. Your NetID makes a
     good GitHub username.
