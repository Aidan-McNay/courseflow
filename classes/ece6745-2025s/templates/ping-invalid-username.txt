Hi <first_name>,

It looks like the GitHub username you submitted for ECE 6745 (<username>) isn't a valid github.com username.

As a reminder, you can find your GitHub username by going to your profile on github.com; the URL will be in the format github.com/your_username.

Please confirm your GitHub username, and then resubmit the form with the correct username here: https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/72710/quizzes/165285

Thanks!
Prof. Batten
