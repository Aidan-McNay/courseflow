Hi <first_name>,

It looks like you haven't yet submitted a GitHub username for ECE 2300.

We will be using GitHub extensively throughout the semester, so please take a moment to submit your username here:

  https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/65463/quizzes/153416

If you haven't yet created a GitHub account, please do so as soon as possible on github.com, and submit the username above. As a reminder, you can find your username by going to your profile page, where the URL wil be in the format github.com/your_username.

Thanks!
Prof. Batten
